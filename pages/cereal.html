       Although it is not always the most nutritious food option, cereal is a breakfast staple around the world.
       Cereal consists of cooked grains that are often eaten within a broth of milk.  The term 'cereal' generally refers to a large family of grains. However, this term colloquially
       typically refers to processed grains that are consumed during the breakfast time.

       As time has passed, the role of cereal at the breakfast table has steadily declined. Modern cereals
       typically are not chosen for the same nutritional benefits as their earlier predecessors. More often than not,
       they are more of a snack. What's more, the consumption of cereals is not as limited to the morning. Cereal
       is eaten by people all throughout the day.
