        Pizza is a dish that serves as a memento of the homeland of many Italian immigrants.
        This circle-shaped dish traditionally consists of a baked flat-bread with toppings 
        including tomato sauce, cheese.

        Nowadays, you can find practically anything on a pizza. Some put pineapples on their pizza, other's may 
        anchovies. Some even go as far as making 'dessert pizzas' which seek to forsake the savory origins
        of the dish in favor of sweeter possibilities. The versatility of pizza is immense and growing.
