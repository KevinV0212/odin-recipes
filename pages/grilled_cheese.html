        Contrary to what one might imagine, a 'grilled cheese' is not simply a block of cheese that is cooked on a grill. 
        Although this dish is not quite that simple, it is not much more complicated. At it's core, a grilled cheese consists
        of cheese enclosed by bread that is then toasted.

        At it's core, the grilled cheese is a dish that is lauded for it's simple, but wholesome nature. 
        However, that is not to say that this dish cannot be elevated. Through a careful selection of bread, cheese(s)
        and accoutrements, this dish can go from a simple snack to a hearty meal.
